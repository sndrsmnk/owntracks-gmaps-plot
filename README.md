owntracks-gmaps-plot
====================

This repo provies some tools to store OwnTracks data through a Mosquitto MQTT broker in a MySQL database. It also comes with a simple site which plots the data on Google Maps.

So, this only works with the 'Mosquitto' MQTT-broker, available in Ubuntu as package 'mosquitto'. These scripts rely on the client binaries available as package 'mosquitto-clients'.
